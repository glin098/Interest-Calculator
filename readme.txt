Brief overview of program, including any known bugs:
The interest calculator is an interactive program which prompts 
the user for an interest rate and a principal, then calculates and 
prints the balance that would be after one year. We had a file driver which
input random rates, amount of rates, and limits. We implemented error
checking within this program so that it prompts the user to input 
the correct response. No specific known bugs.
